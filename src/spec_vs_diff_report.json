  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo (settlement periods, adjustments, settlement lock enforcement), frontend AppLayout (navigation), and updated project state documenting existing features. The BuildRequest has no explicit requirements and focuses on preservation constraints. The changes appear to be adding settlement periods and adjustments functionality while maintaining existing features.",
